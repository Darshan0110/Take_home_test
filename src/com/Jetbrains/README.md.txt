## General Information
- Project created using java, on intellej
- The objective of the program is to convert numerals into words

- Jetbrains intelleJ IDEA community edition 2022.1.3

##Setup

this program can be run on any Java IDE.
no addition setup is required

## Usage
How does one go about using it?
User enters digits (0 - 999 999 999 999 999) hits enter, program then reads out numbers in correct numerical format.

##Tests

worse case space complexity
O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly proportional to the input size

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ / _no longer being worked on_. As it meets requirements


## Room for Improvement
Program only runs for one input by user, perhaps a loop could be implemented
